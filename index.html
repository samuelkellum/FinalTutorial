  <h1>Milestone 1</h2>
  <p>For our collaboration plan, we decided to meet up to discuss what data about New Orleans we wanted to discuss. We set up a GitHub repository at first where we have been putting our data sources. Both of us were interested in data about crime in New Orleans. More specifically, we wanted to look into policing violence and where these incidents were happening in the city. These sorts of data sets open up many possible questions and avenues that we can go down. For example, we were discussing combining datasets to determine who and where these violent interactions were happening. Were they happening disproportionately in poor areas? Were they happening disproportionately towards African Americans? 

    Additionally, we are interested in exploring how different parts of the city have recovered from Hurricane Katrina. For example, even 15 years later, we know that New Orleans has still not fully recovered in population from before the storm. One dataset we found has information on the status of various houses that have been destroyed by the hurricane. It makes sense that the most essential functions of the city would be repaired first, but poor people who were displaced from New Orleans likely did not have as strong of an alternative outside of their homes and needed their houses repaired quickly. Did it take longer to rebuild houses in poor areas? Are some of those houses still destroyed? Are there significantly more vacant houses in poor areas that were destroyed by the hurricane?
